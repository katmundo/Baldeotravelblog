      <h2>DAY 1: ARRIVING IN BALER</h2>
     <p>
      Our day started as early as 2am since Baler Aurora is 6hrs away from Obando Bulacan. 
      I also recommend departing early so you can have an early tour in Baler without other tourists 
      which can cause exhaustion in falling in long line in museums and parks. We arrived in Baler 
      around 8am and we ate our first breakfast so we could have energy. Our first destination is the 
      Baler Park where there is a big Baler signage where you can take pictures. On the side of the park
       you can also visit the Baler church which is historic because it plays an important role during the 
       siege of baler. The next thing we visited is the house of Dona Aurora Quezon House which is located 
       in the front of the church. Inside the house you can see many antics that were used by the late president
        Manuel L Quezon and of course by Dona Aurora like books, clothes and many more which is amazing that they
       preserve those kinds of things. The next place we visit is the Museo de Baler which is located across from 
        Baler park. The museum has many historical facts about the town. There are also many things and visuals like 
        paintings, pictures, clothes and many more which is very informative. The House of Dona Aurora and Museo de Baler
        has an entrance fee which is only less than 100 which is very affordable and for me it is worth it because I love
        history and i appreciate those things. After taking many pictures and a lot of walking we decided to eat our lunch 
       and there are many buffet places which only range from 199 to 400 which is worth it and it has many choices and it 
        was delicious. After that we could now check in at our hotel to have some rest. Our hotel is facing the Sabang
        beach which you could easily enjoy the sea anytime you want. We really enjoy it as a family because the waves
        are very high and there are people also riding their surfing boards that's why you need to be cautious of your
        surroundings while swimming because it might hit you. After a long day we eat our dinner and have some coffee
        afterwards. I might say our first day in baler is very tiring yet it is one of my most unforgettable vacations 
        with my family.

      <h2>DAY 2: DEPARTING FROM BALER </h2>
      <p>
        First thing in the morning we eat our breakfast luckily our hotel offers different silog and coffee. Afterwards 
        we go back again to the beach for one last time since we need to go by 12pm. We took some pictures on the beach 
        and even though we didn't want to go back to the hotel we didn't have a choice. We are preparing to go on tour 
        again before going home but we already loaded our things and bags since we need to check out already. We ate first 
        lunch so we could have enough energy to walk and tour again. Our first destination is the Ermita Hill which is very 
        high and has many stairs but the view upstairs is worth it and you can also take pictures there. The soil there is dirty 
        and can mess with your shoes that's why i recommend you to wear slippers or shoes that are not white. The next place we 
        went is the hanging bridge that is very scary since there are many people in it. The last place we went is the baler port 
        where you could take pictures of the sea and rock formation around it. After that we need to go home since it is already 
        4pm and our journey is long. It's sunday that's why there's traffic everywhere we only eat our dinner around 10pm in NLEX.
         We safely return around 12am it is tiring but it is so much fun and we wanted to return again maybe this year.
