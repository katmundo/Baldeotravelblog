      <h2>HISTORY OF BALER</h2>
      <p>In 1609, seven Franciscan missionaries, led by Fray Blas Palomino, founded the settlement of Baler, which was later converted into 
        a pueblo (town) by the Augustinians and the Recollects in 1658. Due to scarcity of religious missionaries, the Franciscans again 
        took over the administration of the settlement in 1703.</p>

      <p>The early history of Baler is fragmentary though sufficient to indicate that during the early years that preceded the arrival of 
        Franciscan Missionaries, continuous change took place in the human and political geography or the regions, as a result of the 
        migration of people and dissemination of new ideas and cultures.</p>

        <p>It has been foresaid that Baler was already a very progressive and prominent community long before its discovery by the Franciscans.
        The populace source of economic was fishing, hunting, and farming. </p>

        <p>The early Spanish Missionaries of two different religious orders are pioneer builders co Catholicism in Baler, They are the Franciscans and the Recollects, men of God imbued with the gallant courage of crusaders, the fervent faith of martyrs, and noble virtues of saints, without arms, but only with their crucifixes and their rosaries, they penetrated unexplored jungles and crossed uncharted mountains to bring the gospel of Christ to the people; so doing, they suffered untold miseries, even untimely deaths. And to make the evangelization of the people successful, none of these die-hearted and dedicated missionaries left their assigned parishes unless reassigned or ordered elsewhere by their superiors. Their quest to instill the seed for Christianity, their desire for economic wealth, and their aspiration for the grandeur and political glory of Spain led to the exploration of the Sierra Madre and its coastal areas. However, despite the food deeds attributed to the missionaries, 
        dissension arose between them and the military. Using their religious zeal, they overshadowed their military counterparts.</p>

        <p>It became the capital of Aurora on 14 June 1951 under Republic Act No. 648 signed by President Elpidio Quirino. 
          It remained the seat of government of Aurora on 21 November 1978 under Batas Pambansa Blg. 7 signed by President Ferdinand
           Marcos.</p>
